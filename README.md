# birthdays
A simple Android Application which lets you manage Birthdays. It reminds you of these just the way you want it to.
### Motivation
I created this app for the purpose of being independent from other services. I realized that I do not want to forget about the birthday of my flatmate just because he left a social network which normally reminded me of his birthday. Furthermore I dont want a service which transfers all the personal data to the internet. This app does not even have permission to access the internet.
So this app lets you input and manage birthdays you do not want to forget about. You can set notifications to remind you of birthdays. All data is being saved on the smartphone and nowhere else.
### Developer
This app is being developed by Sebastian Oltmanns. For contact, please use sebastian.oltmanns.developer@gmail.com.
### Multiple language support
The app is available in every Google Play Store world wide with standard language being en-GB. But the application has only german and english strings.
If you are willing to translate the Strings of this Application into another language, feel free to contact me or just do a pull request.
### Support for other OS (iOS, Windows, ...)
This app is only available for Android, since I myself am only interested in Android programming so far. If you are interested in doing another Version of this app, feel free to contact me about it!

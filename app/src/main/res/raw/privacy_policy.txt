Privacy policy for the Android application "Manage birthdays" (packagename: com.woodplantation.geburtstagsverwaltung) (hereinafter called "app") from November 10, 2016
The app saves every data that the user enters. These are the data sets for birthdays (first name, last name, birthday, others) and the settings for notifications. The data is stored on the smartphone and nowhere else. The storage location on the smartphone is the default location for app-owned files assigned by the Android operating system. As soon as the user deletes a birthday using the app, the stored data set is also deleted. If the user manually deletes the app's data, all the data entered is deleted. The app should then be as in the delivery condition.
The user can export all entered birthdays (first name, last name, birthday, others) to a file. This file is stored in the smartphone's primary storage and is not encrypted. The risk that arises from this, in particular regarding data protection, lies entirely with the user. 
The app does not transfer any data to any third party and never establishes a connection to the Internet.
Developer of this app and contact person is Sebastian Oltmanns. Contact: sebastian.oltmanns.developer@gmail.com
